          <Question>California Pedestrian Laws and Rights</Question>
          <Paragraph>
            Understanding California's pedestrian laws is essential for
            determining liability in a pedestrian accident case. In California,
            pedestrians generally have the right-of-way in marked and unmarked
            crosswalks. However, pedestrians also have responsibilities, such as
            not suddenly leaving a curb and walking into the path of a vehicle
            that is so close it creates an immediate hazard.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            California Vehicle Code Section 21950 states that drivers must yield
            the right-of-way to pedestrians crossing the roadway within any
            marked or unmarked crosswalk at an intersection. This means that
            drivers must slow down or stop if necessary to allow pedestrians to
            safely cross the street.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            However, the same section also states that pedestrians must not
            suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into
            the path of a vehicle that is so close it constitutes an immediate
            hazard. Additionally, pedestrians must not unnecessarily stop or
            delay traffic while in a marked or unmarked crosswalk.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            California also follows a "comparative negligence" rule, which means
            that even if you were partially at fault for the accident, you may
            still be able to recover damages. Your compensation would be reduced
            by your percentage of fault. For example, if you were found to be
            20% at fault for the accident and your damages totaled $100,000, you
            would be able to recover $80,000.
