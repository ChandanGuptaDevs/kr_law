# Top 5 Mistakes When Hiring a Personal Injury Lawyer

Finding the right legal help or personal injury lawyer can be a daunting prospect. You often have to find a lawyer at a time when you are already experiencing a significant amount of stress and anxiety.

## 1. Hiring a Lawyer Without Personal Injury Experience

Not all lawyers are created equal. Personal injury law is a specialized field that requires specific knowledge and experience. Make sure your lawyer has a proven track record in handling cases similar to yours.

## 2. Not Checking Reviews and References

Before hiring a lawyer, always check their online reviews and ask for references from past clients. This will give you insight into their success rate and how they treat their clients.

## 3. Choosing Based on Advertising Alone

Big advertisements don't always mean the best service. Look beyond the billboards and TV commercials to find a lawyer who truly cares about your case.

## 4. Not Understanding the Fee Structure

Most personal injury lawyers work on a contingency fee basis, meaning they only get paid if you win. Make sure you understand exactly what percentage they'll take and what expenses you might be responsible for.

## 5. Waiting Too Long to Hire a Lawyer

California has a statute of limitations for personal injury cases. The sooner you hire a lawyer, the better they can preserve evidence and build your case.
