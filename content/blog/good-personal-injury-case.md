# What Makes A Good Personal Injury Case?

Not all personal injury cases are created equal. Understanding what makes a strong case can help you evaluate your situation and set realistic expectations for your claim.

## Key Elements of a Strong Personal Injury Case

### 1. Clear Liability
The strongest cases have clear evidence showing the other party was at fault:
- Traffic violations
- Witness statements
- Video footage
- Police reports

### 2. Significant Damages
A good case involves substantial damages that can be documented:
- Medical bills and future medical costs
- Lost wages and loss of earning capacity
- Pain and suffering
- Property damage

### 3. Insurance Coverage
The at-fault party should have adequate insurance or assets to cover your damages. A judgment against someone without insurance or assets may be difficult to collect.

### 4. Documented Injuries
Medical documentation is crucial:
- Immediate medical treatment after the accident
- Consistent follow-up care
- Clear diagnosis and prognosis
- Documentation linking injuries to the accident
