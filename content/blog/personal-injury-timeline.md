# What Is The Timeline For A Personal Injury Case?

Understanding the timeline of a personal injury case can help you set realistic expectations and plan accordingly. While every case is unique, most follow a similar progression.

## Typical Personal Injury Case Timeline

### Immediate: Seek Medical Treatment (Day 1)
Your health is the top priority. Seek immediate medical attention and follow all treatment recommendations. This also begins documenting your injuries.

### Week 1-2: Consult with an Attorney
Contact a personal injury attorney as soon as possible. Early legal representation can:
- Preserve crucial evidence
- Handle insurance communications
- Protect your rights
- Begin investigating your case

### Month 1-3: Investigation Phase
Your attorney will:
- Gather police reports
- Interview witnesses
- Collect medical records
- Document damages
- Assess insurance coverage

### Month 3-6: Medical Treatment & Recovery
Continue with medical treatment until you reach "maximum medical improvement" (MMI). This is when your condition has stabilized, allowing for accurate case valuation.

### Month 6-12: Demand and Negotiation
Once treatment is complete:
- Attorney sends demand letter to insurance company
- Negotiations begin
- Most cases settle during this phase

### Month 12-18: Filing a Lawsuit (If Necessary)
If negotiations fail:
- Lawsuit is filed before statute of limitations
- Discovery phase begins
- Depositions are taken
- Mediation may be attempted

### Month 18-24+: Trial Preparation and Trial
If no settlement is reached:
- Trial preparation intensifies
- Trial typically lasts 3-5 days
- Verdict is rendered
- Appeals may follow

## Factors That Affect Timeline

### Factors That Speed Up Cases:
- Clear liability
- Well-documented injuries
- Cooperative insurance companies
- Reasonable settlement expectations

### Factors That Slow Down Cases:
- Disputed liability
- Complex injuries requiring extended treatment
- Multiple parties involved
- Uncooperative insurance companies
- Need for expert witnesses

## California Statute of Limitations

You generally have 2 years from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit in California. However, there are exceptions:
- Government claims: 6 months
- Medical malpractice: 1 year from discovery (max 3 years)
- Minors: Until age 20

## Why Patience Pays Off

While it's natural to want quick resolution, rushing can result in:
- Accepting lowball offers
- Missing future medical costs
- Incomplete understanding of injuries
- Inadequate compensation
